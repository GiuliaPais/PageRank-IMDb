# PageRank for IMDb data set

This repo contains the project for the final assignment of the course
*Algorithms for Massive Datasets* of the Master Degree in Informatica,
Universit√† Statale di Milano 2020/2021. The aim is to implement from
scratch the original PageRank algorithm and a few of its variations and
apply them to a network of movie actors built from the IMDb dataset
freely available on Kaggle.

All the code is available in the Jupyter notebook contained in this
repo, it can be opened directly in Google Colab: [![Open In
